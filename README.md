# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis

## Project Overview

The Coffee Shop Sales Analysis project provides a comprehensive review of sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends for a fictional coffee shop chain. By analyzing key metrics such as total sales, footfall, average bill per person, and product category performance, this project aims to uncover actionable insights that can drive strategic decisions in areas like inventory management, marketing, and customer experience.

The analysis is presented through an interactive dashboard created using Excel, which allows users to explore data across different dimensions, including time of day, day of the week, and store location. Key questions addressed by this analysis include:

- Which products and categories are the top revenue generators?
- How does customer footfall vary by time and location?
- What are the peak hours for sales, and how do they impact staffing needs?
- How do average bill and order sizes compare across different store locations?

The findings from this analysis can help the coffee shop chain better understand its customer base, optimize its product offerings, and improve overall operational efficiency.

## Key Insights

1. **Total Sales**: 
   - The coffee shop chain generated a total revenue of **$698,812.33** over the analyzed period. This significant revenue figure indicates strong overall sales performance across all store locations. It reflects the popularity of the coffee shop’s offerings and the effectiveness of its sales strategies.

2. **Total Footfall**:
   - The coffee shops collectively recorded a total footfall of **149,116** customers. This metric highlights the coffee shop's ability to attract a substantial number of customers. High footfall is crucial for sustaining revenue growth and indicates good customer traffic at the store locations.

3. **Average Bill Per Person**:
   - The average bill per customer was **$4.69**. This figure provides insight into the spending behavior of customers. A modest average bill suggests that customers frequently purchase affordable items, making it essential for the coffee shop to maintain high volume sales to achieve profitability.

4. **Average Orders Per Person**:
   - On average, customers placed **1.44 orders per visit**. This indicates that many customers either purchase multiple items per visit or return for additional purchases. Understanding this behavior can help in designing promotions and menu combinations that encourage higher spend per customer.

5. **Sales Distribution by Category**:
   - **Tea** was the leading product category, accounting for **39%** of total sales, followed by **Coffee** at **28%**. Other categories like **Bakery** (12%) and **Branded Products** (10%) also contributed significantly. This distribution suggests that while traditional tea and coffee items are core to the business, diversifying into bakery and branded products has been effective in boosting overall sales.

6. **Sales Distribution by Size**:
   - The data shows that **Regular** (31%) and **Small** (30%) sizes were almost equally popular, together comprising over 60% of total orders. The popularity of smaller sizes suggests that customers value portion control or are making frequent, lower-cost purchases. **Large** sizes accounted for 30% of orders, appealing to customers looking for more substantial servings.

7. **Footfall and Sales by Store Location**:
   - Among the store locations, **Hell’s Kitchen** led with the highest footfall of **50,735** customers and generated **$236,511.17** in sales. **Astoria** followed closely with **50,599** customers and **$232,243.91** in sales, while **Lower Manhattan** had **47,782** customers and **$230,057.25** in sales. This indicates that all locations performed similarly well, but Hell’s Kitchen slightly outperformed the others in revenue, suggesting its strategic importance.

Other top sellers included **Brewed Black Tea** ($47,932.00) and **Brewed Chai Tea** ($77,081.95). These products represent key offerings that drive sales, and focusing on these items can help maintain strong revenue streams.

9. **Order Timing Insights**:
   - Sales data reveals that the busiest hours are between **8 AM and 10 AM**, aligning with the morning rush when customers are likely purchasing breakfast and coffee. This peak period accounts for a substantial portion of daily revenue, highlighting the importance of ensuring adequate staffing and inventory during these hours to maximize sales opportunities.

10. **Weekday vs. Weekend Performance**:
    - The analysis shows consistent sales throughout the weekdays, with slight dips on the weekends. This trend suggests that the coffee shop is frequented more by weekday commuters and professionals, emphasizing the need for targeted promotions to attract weekend customers.
